          <h2>Correlations Found Between Smoking and Obesity</h2>
          <p>Breaking news from the Data Investigation Bureau has shocked the nation. There is a definite correlation observed 
            between a state's obesity rate and its smoking population. Those who express surprise at this news are just pretending.
            The observation is logical and obvious. Health education clearly teaches people that smoking is bad, and that watching 
            their weight is important.</p>

          <p>The DIB believes this correlation shows that oftentimes the individuals who watch their weight are the same people who don't pick up smoking. 
            While obesity may have a genetic component which individuals cannot control, smoking is generally accepted as a choice. This is why the relationship is not perfect.
            The disconnect can be seen in the data from Utah, where the predominant religion condemns the use of tobacco, but the obesity rate is not equally low.</p>

          <p>I hope you've enjoyed my findings, Julia. See you next class.</p>
